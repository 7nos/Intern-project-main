    "summary": "'Hello' is a common English greeting, used to initiate conversation or acknowledge someone's presence.  Its meaning is straightforward: it conveys a friendly and informal salutation.  While its precise etymology remains debated, it's widely believed to have evolved from the earlier phrase 'hollo', itself a variant of 'holla', and is connected to a broader history of vocalizations used for getting someone's attention. Usage varies depending on context; it is typically appropriate for informal settings and conversations, and its informality makes it unsuitable for highly formal occasions.",
