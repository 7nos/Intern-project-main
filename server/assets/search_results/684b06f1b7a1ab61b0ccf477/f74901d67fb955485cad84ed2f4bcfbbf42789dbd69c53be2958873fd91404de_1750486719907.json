    "summary": "Information can be categorized in numerous ways, depending on the context and purpose of the classification.  Broadly, information can be classified based on its structure (e.g., numerical, textual, visual, audio), its source (e.g., primary, secondary), its format (e.g., digital, analog), or its purpose (e.g., factual, opinion, instructional).  More specialized schemes exist, such as those used in libraries and archives for organizing and retrieving documents, which often incorporate multiple classification criteria.  These schemes typically employ hierarchical structures, allowing for granular categorization and effective information management. The specific method of classification depends heavily on the needs of the user and the intended application.",
